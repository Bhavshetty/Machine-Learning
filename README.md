# Machine-Learning

All-About-Machine Learning
Can we learn about the world around us using data?

Model building from data
Take data as input
Find patterns in the data
Summarize the pattern in a mathematically precise way
Machine learning automates this model building.

Machine learning
The ability of a computer to do some task without being explicitly programmed.
The ability to do the tasks come from the underlying model which is the result of the learning process.
The model is generated by learning from huge volume of data, huge both in breadth and depth reflecting the real world in which the processes are performed.

What machine learning algorithms do?
Search through the data to look for patterns in form of trends, cycles, associations, etc.
Express these patterns as mathematical structures.



Learning Objective: The main objective here is to get started with the Machine learning basics. So let's get started.

Audience: Freshers/ beginners Anyone who wants to get started with Machine Learning
